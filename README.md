# Templated Latex source using Python + Jinja2

1. create a venv
2. install the dependencies in `requirements.txt`
3. run the `test.py` file
4. `out.tex` is produced which can then be compiled to pdf using something like pdflatex or another python package

This is a powerful technique for generating lots of pretty PDFs using JSON or some other data source.
